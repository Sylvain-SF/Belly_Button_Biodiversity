# Overview of Project:

Many bacterial species are not well study, and many more are still unknown to science.<br>
A microbiology laboratory try to discover bacterial species with abilities to synthesize and taste like beef.They already synthesize some from algae, fungi or micro-organism find on plant roots for example, but still search for the elusive bacteria who will provide the perfect taste.<br>
Partnering  with a start-up (Improbable Beef), they run a project on a panel of people to test hypothesis that these bacterias could be found in the human body, more particularly inside the belly button.<br>
Each person participating will be anonymous and will be assigned a specific ID number.<br>

Our problematic is how to best convey data and information to volunteers as well as researchers.<br>
Also what is the best way to visualize each type of bacteria present in individual. If it could be synthesized, volunteers will be aware and able to sell them to Improbable Beef. 


# Results:

When webpage users choose any ID, the data in Demographic Info as well as in all charts give information about this specific test subject volunteer.  



# Summary:

We create a dashboard with a dropdown menu, where each anonymous volunteers can be found.<br>
After selecting an ID, we give access to demographic info about this ID as well as visualizations:
- A bar-chart showing the top 10 bacterias present in individuals and their amount.
- A bubble-chart showcasing the bacteria cultures per sample.
- A gauge-chart giving information on the washing frequency of the belly button.

If Improbable Beef identifies a species to manufacture synthetic beef, any volunteers will be able to pinpoint if that species is found in their navel.

In a second part to ensure access to volunteers and researchers, we deploy our dashboard to an open source system, like that one and all can easily access their information while all data stay anonymous.
